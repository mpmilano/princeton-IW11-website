        <p>Hello all!</p>
<p><strong>(TL;DR: fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/6RVDm6GivRmxdr7S7">form</a> and
check the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr24/cosIW11/">website</a> for more
information)</strong></p>
<p>I am writing to welcome you to the Independent Work Seminar on
“Wrestling with Distributed Systems&quot; and to introduce myself as your
independent work adviser.  Welcome!</p>
<p>Almost every major application out there is a distributed system, even
things as simple as Microsoft Word or as complicated as the stock
market. You interact with distributed systems when you turn on your
phone, send an email or message, buy a ticket to a concert, or do
almost any basic activity as part of daily life.  And while working in
core distributed systems can be mountains of complexity, the
distributed applications built atop core systems—the actual chat
clients, ticket sales, or email portals—are often surprisingly simple.
Using cloud-based distributed services, one can build a scalable,
responsive distributed chat server—the &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; of distributed
systems—with as much ease as building the local equivalent just on a
laptop.</p>
<p>In this IW seminar, we&rsquo;ll be using services exposed directly by the
major clouds to build distributed applications of your choosing! Along
the way we&rsquo;ll discuss what potential applications you&rsquo;d be most
interested in building, how cloud infrastructure works in practice,
how to navigate the choices between many different cloud providers
and, ultimately, how to build an application by gluing together these
existing services and get a seamless solution as a result.</p>
<p>In order to plan an excellent semester for all of us, it&rsquo;ll be really
helpful to know a little bit more about your backgrounds on day
zero—before we&rsquo;ve even had the first lecture.  To collect this
information, I&rsquo;ve made a little <a href="https://forms.gle/6RVDm6GivRmxdr7S7">google form</a> with questions about what
programming languages you&rsquo;ve used, what parts of computer science
excite you, and your comfort on the command line.  Please fill it out
within the next few days! I&rsquo;ll use the results to build our first
lecture, so the more information I&rsquo;m able to get from you, the better
that lecture will be :)</p>
<p>More information about our particular seminar can be found at <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring24/cosIW11">the course website</a> The page
is just a skeleton right now, but stay tuned as I will be adding to
it.  There will be a schedule on the web page that lists the key due
dates for independent work milestones.  Please take a look and
familiarize yourself, noting that our first meeting is Thursday Feb 1
at 11AM in room 302 in the Computer Science building.</p>
<p>Starting today and throughout the semester, we will communicate via <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/55478/discussion/">Ed</a>.
Please feel free
to post messages to me and/or other students there.  It is my hope
that we are all able to help one another, partially through posting
and answering questions on Ed.  If you need to reach out to me
specifically, please also send me an email at
<a href="mailto:mpmilano@cs.princeton.edu">mpmilano@cs.princeton.edu</a>!</p>
<p>Students are welcome to work on separate, unrelated projects. However,
it is my hope that we&rsquo;ll develop into a couple small groups which will
work on related projects, allowing us to take advantage of shared
infrastructure and shared knowledge to greatly enhance each projects'
potential!  For example, two students could collaborate on one
application, with one student handling the traditional &ldquo;backend&rdquo;
concerns—like handling distributed storage—while another works on
&ldquo;frontend&rdquo; concerns, like the visible web portal or other
application-specific logic.  Or some students could work on
coding/implementations while another student explores correctness or
formalizes security requirements.   Of course, collaboration is not
required, but I would like to encourage it because I think it will be
more fun and productive for everybody. You can see the other students
in this email message, and in addition, I believe there are a couple
more planning to join us when course registrations reopen.   Please
feel free to contact any of them and/or post on Ed to propose project
ideas and collaborations before the semester starts or during the
first few weeks of the semester.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now.  I just want to say that I am very excited for
this seminar.  It is going to be great.  Glad that you can be part of
it!</p>
<p>~Mae</p>
