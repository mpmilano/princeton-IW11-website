        <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s proposals week! Most of you are well on your way to writing an
excellent proposal for next week, but I still wanted to share some
&ldquo;tips and tricks&rdquo; that will help make our proposals everything they
can be.  Note that example proposals <em>are available</em>, but I can&rsquo;t post
them anywhere so you&rsquo;ll need to come to me during hours to see one.</p>
<h1 id="some-useful-tools">Some useful tools</h1>
<p>A lot of folks are interested in getting increased visibility into
cloud-based systems!  It may well be the case that the public cloud
isn&rsquo;t capable of providing this for us.  If so, you might want to
check out <a href="https://www.cloudlab.us/">CloudLab</a>, which is a
meta-cloud&mdash;an online cloud-like service <em>for building clouds</em>.  It&rsquo;s
pretty cool, but also leaves a lot of the control up to you&mdash;so you
may wind up needing to do more work than you&rsquo;d otherwise expect.</p>
<h1 id="reading-papers">Reading papers</h1>
<p>A bunch of people have projects that will involve reading a few
research papers to get started.  This is a daunting task&mdash;even the
&ldquo;accessible&rdquo; systems papers can take up to 4 hours to read cover to
cover.  Thankfully, there&rsquo;s an alternative: don&rsquo;t read the whole thing
at once!  There&rsquo;s lots of thoughts on how to understand what parts of
a research paper will be useful <em>without</em> just reading the whole
thing.  My favorite resource in this space is the &ldquo;How to read a
paper&rdquo;
<a href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf">paper</a></p>
<h1 id="proposals-as-a-lodestar">Proposals as a lodestar</h1>
<p>The proposal revolves around a core idea or final deliverable: the
thing you&rsquo;re building this semester, in one sentence.  It&rsquo;s important
to scale this to the size of the semester, but I&rsquo;d encourage you to be
reasonably ambitious while doing so! It&rsquo;s not a crisis if we can&rsquo;t
reach this proposal entirely; the point of it is to set a direction,
and to motivate the next bit:</p>
<h1 id="proposal-sub-goals">Proposal Sub-goals</h1>
<p>Once you have your idea of a &ldquo;lodestar&rdquo; sentence in mind, the next
step is to divide that up into a series of smaller projects which,
when composed, make the final whole.  These smaller projects should
&ldquo;look complete&rdquo; on their own; it should be possible to imagine them as
a &ldquo;final project&rdquo; for a course, or a less-ambitious IW project.  That
means they need to have an independent deliverable, and (just as
important!) they need to have an evaluation.  Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="plan-for-evaluation">Plan for evaluation</h1>
<p>An important part of your proposal will be your evaluation plan: how
you expect to measure success in your project once you&rsquo;ve finished it
(same for smaller sub-projects). The way to find a good evaluation is
to imagine what someone would need to be convinced of your work; or
what questions someone might ask if they&rsquo;re deciding to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; your
product at the end of the semester.  These can start quite vague! For
example, an &ldquo;evaluation question&rdquo; might be &ldquo;is your application going
to work on my older phone&rdquo; or &ldquo;will your infrastructure layer slow
down my workload.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of these questions, you need to try and
understand how you&rsquo;d answer them&mdash;and what particular metrics or
features you could cite in order to do so.  For example, you might
answer &ldquo;will this work on an old phone&rdquo; by suggesting that the memory
usage never exceeds a certain threshold, and that the processor load
stays under a certain percentage.  Or, you could answer &ldquo;will this
slow my workload down&rdquo; by promising that the request latency will
never increase by more than 5ms, or that the added load on the system
doesn&rsquo;t scale with request rate.</p>
<p>What these thresholds then do is tell you what your evaluation needs
to measure&mdash;memory usage, processor load, request latency, or
anything else!</p>
<p><strong>This measurement is your evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Your evaluation will consist of performing these measurements, and
reporting them.  To accurately get an idea of what these metrics will
mean under real-world scenario, you&rsquo;ll want to vary the circumstances
under which you collect particular metrics.  For example, when
measuring memory pressure, you could change overall load on the
system, number of connected clients, size of the available heap, or
any other aspect of your system that naturally changes over time or
across users.  This will give us a sense of how your system scales.</p>
<p>An ideal evaluation would then compare this measurement against a
baseline of other tools in this space which solve similar (or even
identical) problems.  Not all projects are suited to this sort of
comparison, however.</p>
