      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some vague project ideas, with some basic information about which paradigms are well-suited to which ideas. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that this helps our brainstorming!&#xA;Local-first ideas an online collaborative editor for music, art, or anything else! a ahare-alike / buy-nothing app for arranging trades a course shopper that lets you see where your friends are enrolled a social application where you can post messages and reply to threads a collaborative application for reporting sightings of scooters Serverless ideas an online service for editing images in a predictable way a recognition pipeline for identifying items in images a continuous-integration service for compiling or checking code a compression service for removing duplicates and enforcing consistent naming in a hosted storage bucket Traditional VM ideas Most applications can be a good fit for traditional VMs&amp;mdash;including all of the above!</description>

      <title>Collaboration Policy</title>
      <link>https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr24/cosIW11/collaboration-policy/</link>

      <description>Note that this policy is still under construction, and as such is subject to change&#xA;So, we need to talk about chatGPT. As a practitioner and professor, I find myself really torn about how to manage the challenge of modern generative LLMs in a university setting. On the one hand, I want to acknowledge the utility of chatGPT and copilot to solve previously-intractable problems, and their ubiquity in industry today. On the other hand, we&amp;rsquo;re not trying to become promp engineers here: we&amp;rsquo;re trying to become systems engineers.</description>

      <title>Funding Application</title>

      <description>Hi all,&#xA;You should have received an email from SEAS which included instructions for how to apply for individual funding for IW seminars. This includes cloud credits, which we will explicitly need in order to finish our IW projects for this semester. As part of your homework due 2/8, I asked the class to send in (via email to me) drafts of your funding applications for SEAS funding. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at these in the latter half of class on 2/8.</description>

      <title>Paradigm Overview</title>

      <description>In this assignment, due February 8th, we asked the class to take three paradigms of cloud computing, and present a 15-minute talk on how to use each paradigm to write a distributed program.&#xA;Local-First programming In local-first programming, programmers are encouraged to write collaborative applications which share state via a limited number of &amp;ldquo;built-in&amp;rdquo; concurrent replicated data types (CRDTs). Each individual application is written from the perspective of a single client computer.</description>

      <description>Hello all!&#xA;(TL;DR: fill out the form and check the website for more information)&#xA;I am writing to welcome you to the Independent Work Seminar on â€œWrestling with Distributed Systems&amp;quot; and to introduce myself as your independent work adviser. Welcome!&#xA;Almost every major application out there is a distributed system, even things as simple as Microsoft Word or as complicated as the stock market. You interact with distributed systems when you turn on your phone, send an email or message, buy a ticket to a concert, or do almost any basic activity as part of daily life.</description>
