        <p>One of the main recurring assignments we will have in this course is
the two-week plan.  In summary: while the proposal allows you to
understand where your project should be towards the <em>end</em> of the
semester, it does a poor job of telling you what you should be doing
on <em>any given day</em> in order to succeed. To address this, we&rsquo;re
introducing a mandatory planning exercise for class:</p>
<p><strong>Write a plan for the next two weeks</strong></p>
<p>This plan will be due at the beginning of each class, and should cover
the two weeks <em>following that class session</em>.  This plan will list a
number of tasks, along with the days on which you intend to work on
those tasks and your best estimate for the time each task will take to
complete. While this plan covers two weeks, each individual task in
the plan should be able to be completed in a much shorter time
frame&mdash;ideally a few days, or even a few hours.</p>
<p>In addition, we are introducing a companion mandatory exercise:</p>
<p><strong>list the tasks you completed in the previous week, and the time each took to complete</strong></p>
<p>Every class session, we&rsquo;ll take the set of things you completed, and
compare it to the set of things that you had intended to complete, and
see how well they line up.  You will then use that information to
adjust your <em>next</em> two-week plan, while keeping in mind the need to
stay on-track for your end-of-semester goals.</p>
<p>You may find it helpful to use other planning tools when building out
this schedule, for example a <strong>Gantt chart</strong> covering which phases of
the project should be complete during each week of the semester, or a
trello board of individual tasks.</p>
