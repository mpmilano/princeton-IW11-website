        <h1>Paradigm Overview</h1>
    </header>
    
    <div class="content__body">
        <p>In this assignment, <strong>due February 8th</strong>, we asked the class to take
three paradigms of cloud computing, and <strong>present a 15-minute talk</strong>
on how to use each paradigm to write a distributed program.</p>
<h1 id="local-first-programming">Local-First programming</h1>
<p>In local-first programming, programmers are encouraged to write
collaborative applications which share state via a limited number of
&ldquo;built-in&rdquo; concurrent replicated data types (CRDTs).  Each individual
application is written from the perspective of a single client
computer.  Distributed application development is therefore &ldquo;almost
the same&rdquo; as local application development; the programmer does not
usually need to worry about complex APIs, consistency issues, or even
connectivity to the internet.  All clients share a set of CRDT
instances, which any client may use to read or write globally-visible
state.  The &ldquo;catch&rdquo; is that these datatypes are limited to only a few
collections and document abstractions.  Local-first programs are
usually quite cheap to run, with most code executed on client
computers and only communication handled by cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>We will learn more about local-first programming from Ankhi and Aylin</strong></p>
<h1 id="serverless-functions">Serverless Functions</h1>
<p>With serverless functions, programmers design their applications as
small scripts, functions, or program fragments whose execution is
triggered by events on a certain cloud service, such as the upload of
a new file, submission of a form, or even click on a cloud-hosted
webpage.  Serverless functions are usually short, and have a limited
runtime budget, leading to architectures where longer or more
computationally-interesting tasks are divided up between multiple
functions.  Programmers can write serverless functions in many
different languages, and each serverless function interacts with the
outside world primarily via API calls on hosted / managed services
provided by the same cloud provider. Classic examples of serverless
functions would be a function which crops and resizes uploaded images
on a web form, a function which sends out notifications or logging
emails in response to a new file upload, or a function which uses the
result of a database query to insert data into a storage bucket.
Serverless functions only bill for the time spent executing, making
them an economical choice for workloads that cannot run effectively on client computers.</p>
<p><strong>We will learn more about serverless functions from Emilio, Jonathan, and Chai</strong></p>
<h1 id="traditional-virtual-machines">Traditional Virtual Machines</h1>
<p>Traditional virtual machines are the stalwart abstractions of the
cloud, providing the ability for programmers to rent time on full
linux instances and install and run basically whatever they want!
Traditionally these machines are configured via a cloud provider&rsquo;s
APIs, which can include customizing firewall and access rules,
creating shared and moveable volumes, and registering services that
these machines will provide.  Typical uses of these machines are for
running full distributed services which are not available directly via
the vendor; for example, running a MySQLCluster database or a
Cassandra Datastore.  In application development, these VMs can be
used to encode full application logic for situations too long-running
to be suitable for serverless workflows, or too communication-heavy to
be supported by local-first datastructures.  The challenge with
running traditional virtual machines is twofold: first, configuration,
provisioning, and scaling must be handled directly by the programmer,
and cannot be fully delegated to the cloud service.  The second is
that traditional virtual machines can be quite expensive; you pay for
the amount of time the machine is on and running, <em>not</em> for the amount
of work the machine performs.</p>
<p><strong>We will learn more about traditional virtual machines from Lane and Tong</strong></p>
